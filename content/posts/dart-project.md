I thought it would be interesting to try learning a new programming langauge.

So i followed the [instructions](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-angulardart-web-app) provided.

I originally published it to github pages as an experiment.  This should now have been [moved](../../project/)
