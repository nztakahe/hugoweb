* Why the bias on Google Cloud Products
I have a bias to Google Cloud services because 
1. Using there 12 month "free trial" which is a $300 credit
2. Sydney based Data Centre reduces the latency
3. I attended the equivilent of the "Architecting with Google Cloud Platform" course at the Google Sydney campus
4. The compute engine had some really cool things Global IP address, Global VPC and now between projects, auto increasing allocated disk.
5. I was had previously been administering AWS services and want to continue to learn\evaluate competitors.
