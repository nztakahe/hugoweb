# React App
I started helping someone with a personal project using springboot and react tied together with a maven build pipeline.

He asked me to look at making some changes to the react project and I soon become sick of needing to rebuild the war file to see the changes and started looking for a better way.

## Some Findings

### Using Proxy and hot reload.
React Express uses sockets.io for hot reloads and proxying requests appears to stop hot reloading.

```
  "proxy": {"/api/*": {"target": "http://localhost:8080", "ws": false}}
```
