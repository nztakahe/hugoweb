# VS Code
Another page with a collection of links and notes that I am accumulating while learning how to use the VS Code IDE.  This [article](https://www.codementor.io/mattgoldspink/best-text-editor-atom-sublime-vim-visual-studio-code-du10872i7]) evaluates the main IDE's.

It is available for [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) and installation is pretty straight forward.

### VS Code Addons
As with most IDE's the Addons (and managing of them) is the big win.  Some I found helpful are:

[Quokka](https://quokkajs.com/)

[FiveThings: Five VS Code Extensions You Should Know About](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzKk4Wfnz1k)

1. [Git Lense](https://cda.ms/v3)
2. [Version Lense](https://cda.ms/v4)
3. [Prettier](https://cda.ms/v5)
4. [Format Toggle](https://cda.ms/v6)
5. [Settings Sync](https://cda.ms/v7)
6. [Theme - Cobalt2](https://cda.ms/v8) - technically not an addin.


### Debugging
Enable [Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) with changes to launch.json.
