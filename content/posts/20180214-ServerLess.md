#Serverless - Some learning curve 
With a sysops background I like servers. I understand and know them and the flexibility that comes with having them.  Along with that i have experienced the cost of supporting and maintaining them - it was my job.

So i wondered what is involved in creating something that uses Server Less infrastructure.

[*Google* Serverless Cloud](https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=serverless+cloud) and found [Google cloud functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) which as it turns out is a  Beta product - but if you have to start learning something somewhere and I had the idea of creating an API endpoint.  

So Google Cloud Functions current Node.js version is Node v6.11.5.  So something else to learn - Cool.
