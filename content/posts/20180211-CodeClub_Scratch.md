A friend of mine started doing [Code Club](https://codeclub.nz/) at the local schools.  With the recent christmas holidays I thought it would be a great Father and Son project.

Starting with the [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) you can find the  [projects](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/scratch/)

Basically it is drag and drop programming and you can create some games quickly - The code club [example 3] (https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/scratch/ghostbusters/) with a score was a big success.

I have to say that it has been interesting.  There was not any sparks or head trauma with learning that code starts with events and the loops\conditions were not that bad either.  Testing any changes because it was changed is only done if it is a *game* which gets played repeatedly.

Personally It took me a little time before I realise that the pictures\sprites\custumes have a vector mode which allows resizing and moving the individual opjects and bitmap mode that is pretty simple.  This improved the quality (7 year art) but did not really reduced the time spend - But the creativity part is the big reward not learning the logic structures which are just a by product.

While teaching my son, my parents - his grand parents - thinking what it might have been like if theses tools were available in the dark ages of my youth.  I will be honest, BASIC on the Commodore 64 never gave me the best programming skills. [Linus Torvalds] (https://blog.codinghorror.com/linus-torvalds-visual-basic-fan/) appearantly doesnt agree.

Thankfully I never had to learn [LOGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)).
