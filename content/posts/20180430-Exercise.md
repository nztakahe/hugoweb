## My experience
To prove a point to myself that you do not need to go to a gym to get fit and to lose some weight.  Starting with doing some local walks up/down some hills i realised how out of shape I had got.

About 1 month i started a tried a carb free (i didn't quite make it 100%) but I definitely felt the withdrawls, it resulted to losing about 1Kg/week.  I kept up for about 2 months (losing ~ 10Kg) but Christmas holidays.....

While on the diet I kept up with the walking i was doing more laps/reps walking the loops.  Changing the focus from being faster to doing more and increasing endurance.

So around January I realised that my legs and cardio were pretty good (Better than 20 years ago) and realised that I needed to add some upper body.  Thankfully I had caught the idea of doing more reps (with less in them) and later found out that this is basically keeping some Operational Surplus is best practice.

With the coming winter, swimming is a new(ish) idea.  My freestyle technique needs work....  

Stretches and increasing flexibility has been the latest focus.  Most of the discomfort/pain experienced have been resolved (and probably could have been avoided).  This is something that needs more focus.....
