From a corporate Microsoft background I had strong knowledge of Windows (Server desktop), Active Directory, Exchange, IIS, SQL Server etc.  Along with the servers\services I picked up Server Hardware, SANs, Hypervisors (particularly VMWare) and Networking Wireless, Switches and Firewalls and did my fair share of Powershell and vbscript (You used what you could).

In more recent years I was lucky enough to challenge myself to learn\manage the LAMP - Linux (primarily Centos, Ubuntu), Apache 2.4 (and other http services - python\nodejs\load balances etc), mySQL and PHP. As with anything this also included networking with Mikrotiks, scripts using Bash and Python (and tools like Puppet\Ansible) with some Java\Tomcat\postgres thrown in.

I get a kick out of really getting to the root cause and sort of excited automating deploy of the fix.

When not plugged into the acronyms of Internet\Tech I enjoy tramping and try to be the best father I can.
